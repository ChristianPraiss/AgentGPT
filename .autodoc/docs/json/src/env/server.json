  "summary": "This code is responsible for ensuring that the application is not built with invalid environment variables. It is included in the `/next.config.mjs` file and must be a `.mjs` file to be imported there. \n\nThe code imports two modules: `serverSchema` and `serverEnv` from `schema.mjs`, and `clientEnv` and `formatErrors` from `client.mjs`. It then uses `serverSchema` to parse `serverEnv` and stores the result in `_serverEnv`. If `_serverEnv` is not successful, the code logs an error message with the invalid environment variables and throws an error. \n\nNext, the code checks each key in `_serverEnv.data` to see if it starts with \"NEXT_PUBLIC_\". If it does, the code logs a warning message that a server-side environment variable is being exposed and throws an error. \n\nFinally, the code exports an object `env` that combines `_serverEnv.data` and `clientEnv`. This object is likely used throughout the application to access environment variables. \n\nHere is an example of how `env` might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport { env } from \"./env.mjs\";\n\nconst API_KEY = env.API_KEY;\nconst API_URL = env.API_URL;\n\nfetch(`${API_URL}/data`, {\n  headers: {\n    Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,\n  },\n})\n  .then((response) => response.json())\n  .then((data) => console.log(data))\n  .catch((error) => console.error(error));\n```\n\nIn this example, `env` is used to access the `API_KEY` and `API_URL` environment variables, which are used to make an API request.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `schema.mjs` and `client.mjs` files being imported?\n   - The `schema.mjs` and `client.mjs` files are being imported to be used in validating and formatting environment variables.\n2. What happens if the server environment variables are invalid?\n   - If the server environment variables are invalid, an error message will be logged to the console and an error will be thrown.\n3. Why is there a check for environment variables starting with \"NEXT_PUBLIC_\"?\n   - There is a check for environment variables starting with \"NEXT_PUBLIC_\" because these variables are meant to be exposed to the client-side only, and exposing them on the server-side could pose a security risk."
