  "summary": "This code defines a set of functions and an interface for interacting with an AI agent service. The agent service is designed to help users achieve goals by providing prompts and suggestions for tasks to complete. The functions defined in this code allow users to start a new goal, execute a task related to a goal, and create a list of tasks to achieve a goal. \n\nThe `startGoalAgent` function takes in a `modelSettings` object and a `goal` string as arguments. It creates a new `LLMChain` object, which is a language model that can generate text based on a given prompt. The `startGoalPrompt` prompt is used to initiate a new goal, and the `goal` string is passed as a parameter to the prompt. The `LLMChain` object generates a completion based on the prompt and returns it as a string. The `extractTasks` function is then called to extract any tasks from the completion text, and the resulting array of tasks is returned.\n\nThe `executeTaskAgent` function takes in a `modelSettings` object, a `goal` string, and a `task` string as arguments. It creates a new `LLMChain` object with the `executeTaskPrompt` prompt, which is used to prompt the user to execute a task related to the given goal. The `goal` and `task` strings are passed as parameters to the prompt. The `LLMChain` object generates a completion based on the prompt and returns it as a string.\n\nThe `createTasksAgent` function takes in a `modelSettings` object, a `goal` string, an array of `tasks`, a `lastTask` string, a `result` string, and an optional array of `completedTasks` as arguments. It creates a new `LLMChain` object with the `createTasksPrompt` prompt, which is used to prompt the user to create a list of tasks related to the given goal. The `goal`, `tasks`, `lastTask`, and `result` strings are passed as parameters to the prompt. The `completedTasks` array is used to keep track of any tasks that have already been completed. The `LLMChain` object generates a completion based on the prompt and returns it as a string. The `extractTasks` function is then called to extract any new tasks from the completion text, and the resulting array of tasks is returned.\n\nThe `AgentService` interface defines three functions: `startGoalAgent`, `executeTaskAgent`, and `createTasksAgent`. Each function takes in specific arguments and returns a specific type of data. The `OpenAIAgentService` object implements the `AgentService` interface and uses the functions defined in this code to interact with an AI agent service. The `MockAgentService` object is used for testing and provides mock data for the functions. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of functions and an interface for interacting with an AI agent service that can help users achieve goals by providing prompts and suggestions for tasks to complete. These functions can be used in a larger project to integrate the AI agent service into an application or system.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code provides an interface for interacting with an AI agent service that can help with goal setting, task execution, and task creation. It solves the problem of automating these processes and making them more efficient.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies, including \"../utils/prompts\", \"../utils/types\", \"../env/client.mjs\", \"langchain/chains\", and \"../utils/helpers\". \n\n3. What is the difference between the OpenAIAgentService and the MockAgentService?\n- The OpenAIAgentService is the actual agent service that interacts with the AI model and provides real results, while the MockAgentService is a mock version of the service that returns pre-defined results for testing purposes. The code uses the environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_MOCK_MODE_ENABLED to determine which service to use."
