  "summary": "This code defines a router for managing agents in the larger project. The `agentRouter` object has four methods: `create`, `getAll`, `findById`, and `deleteById`. \n\nThe `create` method is a protected mutation that takes an input object with `name`, `goal`, and `tasks` properties. The `name` and `goal` properties are strings, while the `tasks` property is an array of objects that conform to the `messageParser` schema. The method creates a new agent in the database using the `prisma` ORM, with the `name`, `goal`, and `userId` properties taken from the input object and the `id` property generated automatically. It then creates a new `agentTask` object in the database for each task in the `tasks` array, with the `agentId`, `type`, `info`, `value`, and `sort` properties taken from the corresponding task object in the input array. Finally, it returns the newly created agent object.\n\nThe `getAll` method is a protected query that returns an array of up to 20 agents from the database that belong to the current user and have not been deleted. The agents are sorted by `createDate` in descending order.\n\nThe `findById` method is a public query that takes an `id` string as input and returns the agent object with the corresponding `id` from the database, along with an array of associated `agentTask` objects. The `agentTask` objects are sorted by `sort` in ascending order.\n\nThe `deleteById` method is a protected mutation that takes an `id` string as input and marks the corresponding agent object in the database as deleted by setting its `deleteDate` property to the current date.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of CRUD operations for managing agents in the larger project. It uses the `zod` library for input validation and the `prisma` ORM for database access. The `agentRouter` object can be used by other parts of the project to create, read, update, and delete agents and their associated tasks. For example, the `create` method could be used by a user interface to create a new agent with a name, goal, and list of tasks, while the `getAll` method could be used to display a list of agents belonging to the current user.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `agentRouter` object?\n- The `agentRouter` object is a TRPC router that defines four procedures: `create`, `getAll`, `findById`, and `deleteById`, which respectively create a new agent, get all agents, get an agent by ID, and delete an agent by ID.\n\n2. What is the `saveAgentParser` object used for?\n- The `saveAgentParser` object is used to validate the input data for creating a new agent. It expects an object with `name`, `goal`, and `tasks` properties, where `name` and `goal` are strings and `tasks` is an array of objects that match the `messageParser` schema.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `messageParser` schema?\n- The `messageParser` schema is used to validate the `tasks` property of the input data for creating a new agent. It expects an object with `type`, `info`, and `value` properties, where `type` is a string and `info` and `value` are optional strings."
