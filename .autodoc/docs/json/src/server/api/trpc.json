  "summary": "This file sets up the tRPC server for the agentgpt project. It defines the contexts available in the backend API, initializes the tRPC API, and creates routers and procedures that can be used to build the API.\n\nThe first section of the code defines the \"contexts\" that are available in the backend API. These contexts allow access to things like the database and session when processing a request. The `createInnerTRPCContext` helper generates the \"internals\" for a tRPC context, which can be used for testing or when we don't have access to req/res. The `createTRPCContext` function is the actual context used in the router and is used to process every request that goes through the tRPC endpoint.\n\nThe second section initializes the tRPC API, connecting the context and transformer. The `initTRPC` function initializes the tRPC server, and the `superjson` transformer is used to serialize and deserialize data.\n\nThe third section defines the router and procedures that can be used to build the tRPC API. The `createTRPCRouter` function is used to create new routers and subrouters in the tRPC API. The `publicProcedure` is the base piece used to build new queries and mutations on the tRPC API. It does not guarantee that a user querying is authorized, but you can still access user session data if they are logged in. The `enforceUserIsAuthed` middleware is a reusable middleware that enforces users are logged in before running the procedure. The `protectedProcedure` is used for queries or mutations that are only accessible to logged-in users. It verifies the session is valid and guarantees `ctx.session.user` is not null.\n\nOverall, this file sets up the tRPC server for the agentgpt project and provides the necessary pieces to build the tRPC API. Developers can use the defined contexts, routers, and procedures to build queries and mutations for the API.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createInnerTRPCContext` function?\n   \n   The `createInnerTRPCContext` function generates the \"internals\" for a tRPC context, which can be used for testing or in situations where req/res are not available.\n\n2. What is the difference between `publicProcedure` and `protectedProcedure`?\n   \n   `publicProcedure` is a base piece used to build new queries and mutations on the tRPC API, while `protectedProcedure` is only accessible to logged-in users and verifies that the session is valid.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `enforceUserIsAuthed` middleware?\n   \n   The `enforceUserIsAuthed` middleware enforces that users are logged in before running a procedure, and throws a `TRPCError` with code \"UNAUTHORIZED\" if the user is not logged in."
