  "summary": "This code is part of the agentgpt project and is responsible for handling authentication using NextAuth.js. It imports several modules from NextAuth.js, including `getServerSession`, `NextAuthOptions`, and `DefaultSession`. It also imports several providers for authentication, including `GithubProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, and `DiscordProvider`. \n\nThe `authOptions` object is used to configure NextAuth.js. It includes several properties, such as `callbacks`, `adapter`, `providers`, and `theme`. The `callbacks` property is an object that defines functions to be called during the authentication process. In this case, the `session` function is used to add custom properties to the `session` object. The `adapter` property is used to specify the database adapter to be used by NextAuth.js. In this case, the `PrismaAdapter` is used with the `prisma` instance. The `providers` property is an array of authentication providers to be used by NextAuth.js. In this case, the `providers` array includes `GithubProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, and `DiscordProvider`. The `theme` property is used to specify the theme for the authentication pages.\n\nThe `getServerAuthSession` function is a wrapper for `getServerSession` that takes a `ctx` object as an argument and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `Session` object. This function is used to get the user's session on the server-side.\n\nThe `declare module` block is a module augmentation for `next-auth` types that allows custom properties to be added to the `session` and `user` objects. This is used to add a `role` property to the `User` object and a `subscriptionId` property to the `user` object.\n\nOverall, this code is responsible for configuring and handling authentication using NextAuth.js in the agentgpt project. It provides a wrapper function for getting the user's session on the server-side and defines the authentication options to be used by NextAuth.js.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is responsible for configuring authentication options for the agentgpt project using NextAuth.js.\n\n2. What providers are being used for authentication?\n- GoogleProvider, GithubProvider, and DiscordProvider are being used for authentication.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getServerAuthSession` function?\n- The `getServerAuthSession` function is a wrapper for `getServerSession` that allows for authentication session retrieval without needing to import `authOptions` in every file."
