  "summary": "This code defines a set of functions and interfaces related to user authentication using the Next.js framework and the NextAuth library. The `useAuth` function returns an object with four properties: `signIn`, `signOut`, `status`, and `session`. \n\nThe `signIn` function triggers the authentication process with a specified provider (either \"google\" or \"github\"), while the `signOut` function logs the user out of the application. The `status` property indicates the current authentication status, which can be \"authenticated\", \"unauthenticated\", or \"loading\". The `session` property contains information about the current user session, such as the user's email and authentication token.\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to store a unique identifier (UUID) for the user in the browser's local storage when the user is authenticated. This UUID is generated from the user's email address using the `zod` library, which provides a type-safe way to parse and validate data. The UUID is stored in the `UUID_KEY` constant, which is defined at the top of the file.\n\nThis code can be used in a larger project to handle user authentication and authorization. By calling the `useAuth` function, other components in the application can easily access the user's authentication status and session information, as well as trigger sign-in and sign-out actions. The UUID generation and storage functionality can be used to associate user data with a unique identifier, which can be useful for tracking user activity or personalizing the user experience.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useAuth } from \"agentgpt\";\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { signIn, signOut, status, session } = useAuth();\n\n  const handleLogin = () => {\n    signIn(\"google\");\n  };\n\n  const handleLogout = () => {\n    signOut();\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {status === \"authenticated\" ? (\n        <p>Welcome, {session.user.email}!</p>\n      ) : (\n        <button onClick={handleLogin}>Sign in with Google</button>\n      )}\n      <button onClick={handleLogout}>Sign out</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code provides a custom hook `useAuth()` that returns an object with functions for signing in and out of a Next.js app using NextAuth.js, as well as the current authentication status and session data. It solves the problem of managing user authentication in a Next.js app.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several modules from Next.js, including `Session` and `useSession` from `next-auth/react`, and `useRouter` from `next/router`. It also imports `z` from the `zod` library for parsing user data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `UUID_KEY` constant and how is it used?\n- The `UUID_KEY` constant is a string that represents the key used to store a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) in local storage. This UUID is generated from the user's email address using the `zod` library and is stored in local storage when the user is authenticated. It is used to uniquely identify the user across sessions and devices."
