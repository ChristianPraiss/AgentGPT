This code defines two functions that are used to retrieve customer information from the Stripe API. The `getCustomerId` function takes a customer object as an argument and returns the customer ID. The function checks the type of the customer object and returns the ID if it is a string or an object with an `id` property. If the customer object is null or an unexpected type, an error is thrown.

The `getCustomerEmail` function takes a Stripe object and a customer object as arguments and returns the customer's email address. If the customer object is a string, the function retrieves the customer object from the Stripe API using the `retrieve` method and assigns it to a variable `c`. If the customer object is not a string, the function assigns it directly to `c`. The function then returns the email address of the customer object, or an empty string if the email address is not defined.

These functions are likely used in the larger project to retrieve customer information from the Stripe API. The `getCustomerId` function may be used to retrieve the customer ID for a given customer, which can be used to perform other operations on the customer's account. The `getCustomerEmail` function may be used to retrieve the email address of a customer, which can be used to send email notifications or other communications to the customer.

Example usage of `getCustomerId`:

```
import { getCustomerId } from "agentgpt";

const customer = { id: "cus_1234567890" };
const customerId = getCustomerId(customer);
console.log(customerId); // "cus_1234567890"
```

Example usage of `getCustomerEmail`:

```
import Stripe from "stripe";
import { getCustomerEmail } from "agentgpt";

const stripe = new Stripe("sk_test_1234567890", {
  apiVersion: "2020-08-27",
});

const customerId = "cus_1234567890";
const customerEmail = await getCustomerEmail(stripe, customerId);
console.log(customerEmail); // "example@example.com"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines two functions for retrieving customer information from Stripe, specifically their ID and email address.

2. What input types are accepted by the `getCustomerId` and `getCustomerEmail` functions?
   Both functions accept a string representing a customer ID, a `Stripe.Customer` object, a `Stripe.DeletedCustomer` object, or `null`.

3. What happens if the `customer` parameter is `null` or an unexpected type?
   If `customer` is `null`, both functions will throw an error with the message "No customer found". If `customer` is an unexpected type, `getCustomerId` will throw an error with the message "Unexpected customer type", while `getCustomerEmail` will throw a runtime error due to the `await` keyword being used on a non-promise value.
