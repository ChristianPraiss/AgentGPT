This code is part of the agentgpt project and is responsible for handling authentication using NextAuth.js. It imports several modules from NextAuth.js, including `getServerSession`, `NextAuthOptions`, and `DefaultSession`. It also imports several providers for authentication, including `GithubProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, and `DiscordProvider`. 

The `authOptions` object is used to configure NextAuth.js. It includes several properties, such as `callbacks`, `adapter`, `providers`, and `theme`. The `callbacks` property is an object that defines functions to be called during the authentication process. In this case, the `session` function is used to add custom properties to the `session` object. The `adapter` property is used to specify the database adapter to be used by NextAuth.js. In this case, the `PrismaAdapter` is used with the `prisma` instance. The `providers` property is an array of authentication providers to be used by NextAuth.js. In this case, the `providers` array includes `GithubProvider`, `GoogleProvider`, and `DiscordProvider`. The `theme` property is used to specify the theme for the authentication pages.

The `getServerAuthSession` function is a wrapper for `getServerSession` that takes a `ctx` object as an argument and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `Session` object. This function is used to get the user's session on the server-side.

The `declare module` block is a module augmentation for `next-auth` types that allows custom properties to be added to the `session` and `user` objects. This is used to add a `role` property to the `User` object and a `subscriptionId` property to the `user` object.

Overall, this code is responsible for configuring and handling authentication using NextAuth.js in the agentgpt project. It provides a wrapper function for getting the user's session on the server-side and defines the authentication options to be used by NextAuth.js.
