The `globals.css` file in the `src/styles` folder contains a collection of CSS styles that are used throughout the agentgpt project to ensure a consistent visual appearance and formatting. These styles are applied to various HTML elements within the project to achieve the desired effects.

The `background` class creates a radial gradient effect used as the background for the landing page. Example usage:

```html
<div class="background">
  <!-- content goes here -->
</div>
```

The `lower-gradient` class creates a linear gradient effect positioned at the bottom of the page, providing a visual separation between the content and the footer. Example usage:

```html
<div class="lower-gradient">
  <!-- content goes here -->
</div>
```

The `pre` tag is styled to create a rounded code block with overflow scrolling, used for displaying code snippets and formatted text within messages. Example usage:

```html
<pre>
  <code>
    // code snippet goes here
  </code>
</pre>
```

The `window-heights` class sets the height of a container element and applies overflow scrolling to it, ensuring a consistent height for message windows across different screen sizes. Example usage:

```html
<div class="window-heights">
  <!-- message content goes here -->
</div>
```

The `table` tag is styled with a rounded border and a dark background color. The `th` and `td` tags have a rounded border, a gray border color, and padding, used for formatting tables within messages. Example usage:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Column 1</th>
      <th>Column 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
      <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
      <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Additionally, the code defines styles for customizing the scrollbar appearance on webkit-based browsers, creating a scrollbar similar to the one on Mac OS.

In summary, the `globals.css` file provides a set of reusable styles that contribute to the overall visual appearance and formatting of the agentgpt project. These styles are applied to different HTML elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the project.
