[View code on GitHub](/src/components/Label.tsx)

The code defines a React component called `Label` that renders a tooltip with a label inside. The component takes in three props: `left`, `type`, and `toolTipProperties`. 

The `left` prop is a React node that represents the label text to be displayed. The `type` prop is a string that determines the styling of the label. If `type` is equal to "range", the label will have a white border and rounded corners. Otherwise, the label will have a transparent border and rounded corners. The `toolTipProperties` prop is an object that contains properties to be passed down to the `Tooltip` component.

The `Label` component first defines a helper function called `isTypeTextArea` that returns a boolean value based on whether the `type` prop is equal to "textarea". This function is used to conditionally apply a CSS class to the label container element.

The `Label` component then returns a `Tooltip` component that wraps a container `div` element. The `Tooltip` component takes in several props, including a `child` prop that represents the content to be displayed inside the tooltip. In this case, the `child` prop is a `div` element that contains the `left` prop passed down from the parent component. The `Tooltip` component also takes in a `style` prop that sets the width of the tooltip container element to 25% of the viewport width on medium-sized screens and larger. Finally, the `Tooltip` component takes in a `toolTipProperties` prop that is passed down from the parent component.

The `Label` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a parent component could use the `Label` component to render a label with a tooltip that provides additional information about a form field. 

Example usage:

```
import Label from "./Label";

const MyForm = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      <Label left="Name" type="text" toolTipProperties={{ content: "Enter your full name" }} />
      <Label left="Email" type="text" toolTipProperties={{ content: "Enter your email address" }} />
      <Label left="Bio" type="textarea" toolTipProperties={{ content: "Tell us about yourself" }} />
    </form>
  );
};
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Label` component and how is it used in the project?
   - The `Label` component is used to render a tooltip with a label and optional tooltip properties. It takes in props for the label text, type of input, and tooltip properties.
   
2. What is the `isTypeTextArea` function used for and how does it work?
   - The `isTypeTextArea` function is used to check if the `type` prop passed to the `Label` component is equal to "textarea". It returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the type is a textarea input.
   
3. What is the purpose of the `style` prop passed to the `Tooltip` component and how does it affect the rendering of the tooltip?
   - The `style` prop passed to the `Tooltip` component is used to set the width of the tooltip container at different screen sizes. It sets the container width to 1/4 of the screen width on medium-sized screens and larger.
