[View code on GitHub](/src/env/server.mjs)

This code is responsible for ensuring that the application is not built with invalid environment variables. It is included in the `/next.config.mjs` file and must be a `.mjs` file to be imported there. 

The code imports two modules: `serverSchema` and `serverEnv` from `schema.mjs`, and `clientEnv` and `formatErrors` from `client.mjs`. It then uses `serverSchema` to parse `serverEnv` and stores the result in `_serverEnv`. If `_serverEnv` is not successful, the code logs an error message with the invalid environment variables and throws an error. 

Next, the code checks each key in `_serverEnv.data` to see if it starts with "NEXT_PUBLIC_". If it does, the code logs a warning message that a server-side environment variable is being exposed and throws an error. 

Finally, the code exports an object `env` that combines `_serverEnv.data` and `clientEnv`. This object is likely used throughout the application to access environment variables. 

Here is an example of how `env` might be used in the larger project:

```
import { env } from "./env.mjs";

const API_KEY = env.API_KEY;
const API_URL = env.API_URL;

fetch(`${API_URL}/data`, {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
  },
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

In this example, `env` is used to access the `API_KEY` and `API_URL` environment variables, which are used to make an API request.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `schema.mjs` and `client.mjs` files being imported?
   - The `schema.mjs` and `client.mjs` files are being imported to be used in validating and formatting environment variables.
2. What happens if the server environment variables are invalid?
   - If the server environment variables are invalid, an error message will be logged to the console and an error will be thrown.
3. Why is there a check for environment variables starting with "NEXT_PUBLIC_"?
   - There is a check for environment variables starting with "NEXT_PUBLIC_" because these variables are meant to be exposed to the client-side only, and exposing them on the server-side could pose a security risk.
