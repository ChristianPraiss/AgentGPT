[View code on GitHub](/setup.sh)

This code is a Bash script that sets up the environment for the agentgpt project. It prompts the user to enter an OpenAI API key and validates it using the `is_valid_sk_key` function. If the key is valid or empty, it proceeds to generate a `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using `openssl rand -base64 32`. It then sets up the environment variables for the project, including `NODE_ENV`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL`. These variables are written to a `.env` file in the project directory.

The script then checks if the `--docker` flag is passed as an argument. If it is, it writes the environment variables to a `.env.docker` file, builds a Docker image named `agentgpt`, and runs a Docker container with the image. The container is named `agentgpt`, mapped to port 3000, and mounted with the `db` directory in the project directory.

If the `--docker` flag is not passed, the script installs the project dependencies using `npm install`, runs the `useSqlite.sh` script in the `prisma` directory to set up the SQLite database, and starts the development server using `npm run dev`.

This script is used to set up the development environment for the agentgpt project. It ensures that the required environment variables are set up correctly and that the project dependencies are installed. It also provides an option to run the project in a Docker container, which can be useful for deployment. 

Example usage:

```
$ ./setup.sh
Enter your OpenAI Key (eg: sk...) or press enter to continue with no key: sk-abc123...
Valid API key
```

```
$ ./setup.sh --docker
Enter your OpenAI Key (eg: sk...) or press enter to continue with no key: sk-abc123...
Valid API key
Sending build context to Docker daemon  123.4MB

## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this script?
    
    This script sets up environment variables for the agentgpt project, including an OpenAI API key and a NextAuth secret, and then runs the project in development mode.

2. What is the format of a valid OpenAI API key?
    
    A valid OpenAI API key must start with "sk-" and be followed by 48 alphanumeric characters.

3. What is the purpose of the "--docker" flag in the last if statement?
    
    The "--docker" flag is used to build and run the agentgpt project in a Docker container, with the environment variables set in the .env.docker file.
